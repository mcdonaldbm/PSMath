# PSMath
Powershell DSL to add robust math functionality into Powershell

## Overview

PSMath is my attempt to add the ability to do the following in Powershell

-Acos
-Asin
-Atan
-Atan2
-Ceiling
-Cos
-Cosh
-Floor
-Sin
-Tan
-Sinh
-Tanh
-Round
-Truncate
-Sqrt
-Log
-Log10
-Exp
-Pow
-IEEERemainder
-Abs
-Max
-Min
-Sign
-BigMul
-DivRem
-ToString
-Equals
-GetHashCode
-GetType

These are currently methods of the .NET math library - but I am converting them to Powershell for ease of use.  Additionally, I will add support for things like matricies and linear algebra to eventually have a Powershell module capable of contributing to machine learning.
