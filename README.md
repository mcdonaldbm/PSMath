# PSMath

Powershell DSL to add robust math functionality into Powershell

## Overview

Math is not an importable library into Powershell.  Currently, in order to do many math functions you are required to call the .NET Math method directly, causing (in my opinion) ugly code and many keystrokes.  PSMath is my attempt to add the ability to do the following in Powershell

### Constants

- e (exp)
- pi

### Trig

- Cos
- Sin
- Tan

### Operators

- Ceiling
- Floor
- Round
- Truncate
- Abs
- Max
- Min

### And various other functions

- Sqrt
- nRoot
- Log
- Log10
- Pow
- IEEERemainder
- Sign
- BigMul
- DivRem
- ToString
- Equals
- GetHashCode
- GetType

## Version

PSMath is in development - the current version is 0.0.1

## Future Development

If you have suggestions for future development, please submit an issue and I will work on it ASAP.  For now, my future development plans are as follows:

- Matrix operations
- Expanded trig
- Expanded Calc functions
